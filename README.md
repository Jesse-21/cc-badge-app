# Build NFT/SBT platform

## Introduction

**CyberConnect Protocol** is a decentralized social graph protocol that helps Web3 applications bootstrap network effects. It empowers users to truly own their social identities, contents, and connections in a social network and provides developers with a rich set of tools to build applications with meaningful social experiences.

## Project

The repo contains the full code for the How to Build NFT/SBT platform guide from the [CyberConnect Developer Center](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/).

The project was built to help developer with the basic functionalities necessary to develop an NFT/SBT issuing platform by taking advantage of the full power of CyberConnect APIs.

This examples covers all the steps described in the docs:

1. [Authentication](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/how-to/build-a-nft-sbt-platform/authentication)
2. [Create Profile NFT](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/how-to/build-a-nft-sbt-platform/create-profile-nft)
3. [Create Essence NFT](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/how-to/build-a-nft-sbt-platform/create-essence-nft)
4. [Collect Essence NFT](https://docs.cyberconnect.me/how-to/build-a-nft-sbt-platform/collect-essence-nft)

## Installation

```
$ npm install
```

or

```
$ yarn install
```

This command will install all the packages that are necessary to start the development server.

## Local Development

then run the app in the development mode by running the command:

`npm start`
or
`yarn start`

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
